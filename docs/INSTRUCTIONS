# BUILD #
#########

This program requires installing g++ dlib and boost libraries. To compile it you must:
    - build library libdlib.a, create directory "lib/" in the project root and copy "libdlib.a"
      The source code for dlib can be found here : https://sourceforge.net/projects/dclib/
    - copy the dlib headers in the directory "inc/dlib/"
    - type "make" in the project directory

The output executable "deskgen" will be in the project directory. It takes 2 arguments :
    - 1st argument : training data file
    - 2nd argument : file containing all the data to analyze according to the training step

# RUN #
#######

First run the python script "selectData.py" to create a training set out of the data.
You can edit it by setting 2 parameters :
    - tolerance : the minimum variability acceptable to consider the data points
    - density ratio : sets the probability to select a datapoint tha matches the tolerance
We can play with these parameters to control the size of the training set.

Then run the main program which will use the pre-established training set. Make sure you also specify
the file containing the data points to cluster them according to the training set.

NOTE : the files given in argument should not start with the explanatory header
